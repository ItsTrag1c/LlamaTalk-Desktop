# LlamaTalk — Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** March 2, 2026
**Last Updated:** March 6, 2026 (rev. 6)

---

## Overview

The LlamaTalk suite consists of two applications: **LlamaTalk Desktop**, a desktop application for conversing with local and cloud AI models, and **LlamaTalkCLI**, a terminal companion that provides the same capability from any CMD or PowerShell window.

**The short version:** All your data stays on your computer. We don't collect, share, or transmit any information about you or your conversations — except when you explicitly choose to use a cloud AI provider, in which case only your messages are sent to that provider's servers as described below.

---

## Data We Collect and Store

### LlamaTalk Desktop

LlamaTalk Desktop stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Profile credentials** — Your PIN hash and security question hashes are stored in the **Windows Credential Manager**, a secure OS-level keystore. Your username and non-sensitive settings are stored in the app's localStorage.
- **Conversations** — Full message history of all your chats, stored in localStorage. When a profile with a PIN is active, conversations are **encrypted at rest** using AES-256-GCM. The encryption key is stored in Windows Credential Manager — it never touches the filesystem.
- **Cloud API keys** — Stored in the **Windows Credential Manager** (or macOS Keychain), the same secure OS-level keystore used for your PIN. Keys are sent exclusively to their respective AI provider over HTTPS and are never included in profile exports.
- **Export audit trail** — Timestamp of your most recent profile export (`lastExportTime`), displayed in Settings.
- **Settings** — Your preferences including:
  - Ollama server URL
  - Selected AI model and display name (nickname)
  - Theme (light/dark/system)
  - Text size and scroll speed
  - PIN frequency requirement
  - Per-model system prompts ("Base Prompts")
  - Tray behavior preference
  - Temperature setting
  - Hidden models list
  - Enabled cloud providers
  - Detected backend type (Ollama or OpenAI-compatible)

**Deletion log:** When you clear your data via "Clear Data & Users," a one-line timestamped entry is appended to `LlamaTalk-deletion-log.txt` in your application data folder. This file exists solely to give you an audit record of your own deletions and is never transmitted anywhere.

### LlamaTalkCLI

LlamaTalkCLI stores the following data **locally on your device only**, in `%APPDATA%\LlamaTalkCLI\`:

- **Config** (`config.json`) — Your name, hashed PIN, Ollama URL, per-model system prompts, model nicknames, and session preferences. When a PIN is set, cloud API keys are **encrypted at rest** using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from your PIN. Without a PIN, API keys are stored in plaintext.
- **Conversation history** (`history.json`) — Messages from the current session, used for crash recovery only. When a PIN is set, history is **encrypted at rest** using the same AES-256-GCM key.

Both files are restricted to the current Windows user via file system permissions (`icacls`). Other users on the same machine cannot read them.

**Session history:** Conversation history is cleared automatically when you exit LlamaTalkCLI cleanly. If the application exits unexpectedly, the previous session's messages remain in `history.json` and are available on the next launch for recovery. Closing normally always starts a fresh session.

### Data Retention

- **Desktop conversations** — Retained until you delete them via the trash icon or "Clear Data & Users"
- **CLI conversation history** — Cleared on every clean exit; only persists between sessions in the event of a crash
- **Profile & Settings (Desktop)** — Retained until you click "Clear Data & Users"
- **Profile & Settings (CLI)** — Retained in `config.json` until you uninstall or manually delete the file
- **Exported profiles** — If you export your profile, the resulting JSON file is stored wherever you save it — you are responsible for managing that file

---

## Data We Do NOT Collect

The LlamaTalk suite **does not:**

- Collect any analytics, telemetry, or usage data
- Track your behavior or conversations
- Store data on any remote server
- Include tracking cookies or identifiers
- Phone home to report errors or crashes (see **Automatic Update Checks** below for the only automatic network activity)
- Collect information about your device, OS, or installed software
- Share your data with third parties

---

## Message and Prompt Privacy

### Local AI Models (Default)

Both apps support **Ollama** and **OpenAI-compatible local servers** (llama.cpp, LM Studio, vLLM, and similar). The backend type is auto-detected — no manual configuration is needed.

When you send a message to a local model:

1. Your message is sent **only to your local server** (typically running at `http://localhost:11434` or another address you configure)
2. Your message is **not** sent to any cloud AI service
3. Your message is **not** logged, recorded, or shared externally
4. The response is received locally and stored in your conversation history
5. Token usage metadata returned by the server (token counts, generation speed) is used **locally only** for the real-time TK/S display — it is never transmitted anywhere

### Cloud AI Providers (Optional)

LlamaTalk Desktop and LlamaTalkCLI both support optional cloud AI providers: **Anthropic (Claude)**, **Google (Gemini)**, and **OpenAI (GPT)**. These are **disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled and configured with your own API key.

When you send a message to a cloud model:

1. Your message is transmitted to the selected provider's servers over HTTPS
2. The provider's own privacy policy and data handling practices apply to that message
3. LlamaTalk Desktop displays a notice in the chat area identifying which provider will receive your message, and updates that notice when you switch models
4. Your API keys are stored locally — they are **never** sent anywhere except directly to the API endpoint of the provider they belong to
5. API keys are **never** included in exported profile files
6. Token usage metadata returned by the provider (input/output token counts) is used **locally only** for display — it is never stored or transmitted

You remain in full control of which providers are enabled and can disable them at any time in Settings.

### Automatic Update Checks

Both LlamaTalk Desktop and LlamaTalkCLI check for new versions automatically when the app starts. This is the only automatic network activity either app performs. Here is exactly what happens:

1. A single HTTPS GET request is made to the public GitHub Releases API (`https://api.github.com/repos/ItsTrag1c/LlamaTalk-Desktop/releases/latest` or `.../LlamaTalk-CLI/...`)
2. The request includes only a `User-Agent` header identifying the app (e.g. "LlamaTalk Desktop") — **no user data, device identifiers, or analytics are sent**
3. If a newer version is found, a notification appears in the app (Desktop: orange dot on Settings tab; CLI: dim hint after the banner)
4. **No update is downloaded or installed without your explicit confirmation**

GitHub will log the IP address of the request as with any public API call — this is standard for HTTP traffic and is not controlled by LlamaTalk. No additional information is collected or transmitted.

---

## File Operations

### Exporting Profiles and Conversations

- When you export a profile (JSON) or conversation (TXT), the files are saved to your local disk at the location you specify
- LlamaTalk does not automatically upload or transmit these files anywhere
- Exported profiles do **not** contain API keys or your plaintext PIN — only hashed values and non-sensitive settings

### Importing Profiles

- When you import a profile from a file, LlamaTalk validates the JSON structure and applies your data locally
- LlamaTalkCLI restricts imports to `.json` files only
- No data is sent to external servers during import

---

## Encryption & Security

### Data Encryption at Rest

- **Conversations (Desktop)** — When a profile with a PIN is active, all conversations are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before being written to storage. The encryption key is a random 256-bit key generated at profile creation and stored in Windows Credential Manager. Users without a PIN have their conversations stored as plaintext JSON.
- **API Keys (CLI)** — When a PIN is set, all cloud API keys are encrypted in `config.json` using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from your PIN via PBKDF2. Without a PIN, keys remain in plaintext.
- **Conversation History (CLI)** — When a PIN is set, `history.json` is encrypted with the same derived key. Changing your PIN re-encrypts all data with a new key. Removing your PIN decrypts all data back to plaintext.
- **File Permissions (CLI)** — After every write to `config.json` or `history.json`, file permissions are restricted to the current Windows user only, preventing other users on a shared system from reading your data.

### Authentication

- **PIN Hashing** — PINs in both apps are hashed with PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations, SHA-256, random 16-byte per-user salt). Your plaintext PIN is never stored. Legacy hashes from earlier versions are automatically migrated to PBKDF2.
- **PIN Minimum Length (CLI)** — PINs must be at least 4 characters. Both the setup wizard and the PIN change command enforce this minimum.
- **Timing-Safe PIN Comparison (CLI)** — PIN verification uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing side-channel attacks.
- **Credential Storage (Desktop)** — PIN hashes, security question hashes, the conversation encryption key, and cloud API keys are all stored in the OS credential store (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain) rather than in the app's localStorage. A strict allowlist limits which keys the app can read or write.
- **Security Questions (Desktop)** — Security question answers are hashed with SHA-256 and a unique salt before storage. Plaintext answers are never stored.
- **PIN Rate Limiting (Desktop)** — After repeated failed PIN attempts, progressive lockout delays (5 s → 15 s → 30 s → 60 s) are enforced to resist brute-force attacks.
- **Session Inactivity Timeout (CLI)** — After a configurable period of inactivity (default: 30 minutes), the session locks and requires PIN re-entry before continuing. This prevents unattended terminals from remaining unlocked.

### Network & Application Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement** — All cloud API communication uses HTTPS. Endpoints are hardcoded and cannot be downgraded.
- **Server URL Validation** — The local server URL (Ollama or OpenAI-compatible) is validated before every request. Non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes and link-local addresses (169.254.x.x) are rejected.
- **Request Timeouts** — All network calls have enforced timeouts to prevent indefinite hangs (Ollama: 120s, cloud providers: 60s, connection checks: 10–15s).
- **Content Security Policy (Desktop)** — Strict CSP prevents inline scripts, eval(), and unauthorized network connections.
- **Capability Scoping (Desktop)** — Tauri capabilities limit what file and system operations the app can perform to the minimum required.
- **Cloud URL Allowlist (Desktop)** — Outbound API requests are restricted to a hardcoded domain allowlist (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI endpoints). Requests to unlisted domains are rejected. HTTP redirects are disabled to prevent redirect-based SSRF.
- **Update Integrity** — Software updates downloaded from GitHub are verified against SHA-256 checksums using a fail-closed model: if the checksum cannot be retrieved or does not match, the download is rejected. The release URL is validated against a strict GitHub domain pattern before any download begins.
- **Stream Cancellation** — Both apps support cancelling an in-progress response. Desktop's Stop button and CLI's Esc key immediately cancel the active stream on the server side, ensuring no orphaned requests continue. Partial responses are preserved in the conversation.
- **API Key Exclusion from Exports** — Cloud API keys are stripped from all exported profile files in both apps.
- **Import Validation** — Imported profiles are validated for type, format, and value constraints before being applied. The CLI restricts imports to `.json` files only.

## Security Reviews

The LlamaTalk suite undergoes periodic internal security and dependency audits covering:

- Authentication controls (PIN hashing, encryption, and credential storage)
- Data-at-rest encryption (conversations, API keys, history files)
- Input validation across all user-supplied data
- Network security (URL validation, scheme enforcement, request timeouts)
- Dependency auditing for vulnerabilities, telemetry, or unexpected network behavior

Audit findings are documented internally. No critical vulnerabilities have been identified. Known low-severity items are tracked with risk ratings and remediation plans.

---

## Data You Control

You have full control over your data:

- **Access** — Export your profile and conversations at any time
- **Deletion (Desktop)** — Delete individual conversations via the trash icon, or clear all data via "Clear Data & Users"
- **Deletion (CLI)** — Delete `%APPDATA%\LlamaTalkCLI\config.json` and `history.json` to remove all stored data; or uninstall the application
- **Portability** — Your exported profile JSON can be imported into another LlamaTalk installation on another device
- **Encryption control (CLI)** — Set a PIN to enable encryption; remove your PIN to revert to plaintext storage

---

## Third-Party Dependencies

### LlamaTalk Desktop

- **React** (UI framework)
- **Tauri** (desktop framework)
